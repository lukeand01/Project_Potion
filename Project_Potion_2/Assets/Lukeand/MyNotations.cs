//MY NOTATIONS


//i need to create less dependecies between stuff.
//start using playfab maybe.





//CHANGES TO DESIGN

//wheen you talk with npcs you dont have to give anything.
//you instantly roll.
//things can you craft wwith are not sellable and things that are sellable you cannot craft with.


//seed - only in planter and its not an actual item
//plant - result of seed. important because all potions use some plant.
//ingredients - things acquired in dungeons to make better potions.
//potion - the only thing sellable.
//minerals and crystals - not actual item. are used for improveements and buying stuff.
//equippment - not an actual item. used for equipping

//my problem is about display a lot of inventory. limit it.
//it needs ot be fast and to the least amount of thinking necessary. its an auto game.
//


//HOW OBJECTS WILL WORK:
//planter - does not open ui. instead you buy the place and they keep producing. to unluck the field you require the seed. now its an actual item.
//itemholder - open the sellable ui. click and pass the whole stack to the holder. no choosing of exact quantitys
//productions - click to autocollect wwhats inside. to choose production. choose production from a limited possibilities.
//seller - is just get there and sell before clients get tired of waiting.
//


//sell the stuff from the dungeon. a half and half game?
//should aim for infinite game.

//HOW RAID WILL WORK
//its still auto
//simplify the equips and everything because it cannot be overwhelming. 
//you feed them the food they like to increase their level. you get them through cards from chest but only the first one matters.
//they have two weapon slots. they can be improved in the smith. 


//OUTSIDE
//visit smith
//minigames for prizes.
//improve the village so you get better clients.
//buy other places to get things or passive income.
//start a delivery system which are basically potion that you have to create.
